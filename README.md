# MatrixTranspose
LBYARCH

Input Format
Inputs provided are the size and the elements of the matrix. Suppose the input is Matrix A from
the above example. Wherein Matrix A is a 3x2 Matrix. The input would have been:

3.0
2.0
1.0
2.0
3.0
4.0
5.0
6.0

Wherein the first input is the rowsize, second input is the columnsize and the succeeding inputs
are the elements of the matrix from left to right and top to bottom.

Output Format
The output is the transpose of the matrix. An example output is shown below:
1.0 3.0 5.0
2.0 4.0 6.0
